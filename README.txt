# MNIST Digit Recognition Using Pytorch

Training and testing of a simple network to recognise digits in MNIST dataset using Pytorch.

For Training:
```
python mnist_pytorch.py --epochs=number_of_epochs_required --learning_rate=learning_rate_required
```

Model is now saved to the current working directory.

Default number of epochs is 6 and default learning rate is 0.1

For Testing:

```
python test.py
```

>Note: The ipython notebooks are also included.
